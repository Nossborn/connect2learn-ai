==History==
===Foundation===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Swedish inventor Lars Magnus Ericsson.jpg|thumb|upright|Lars Magnus Ericsson]]

[[Lars Magnus Ericsson]] began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm that made [[telegraph]] equipment for the Swedish government agency [[Televerket (Sweden)|Telegrafverket]]. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend [[Carl Johan Andersson]] in central [[Stockholm]] and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.&lt;ref name="BizHistory" /&gt;

Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the [[Bell Telephone Company]]. He bought a number of [[Siemens]] telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for [[Televerket (Sweden)|Telegrafverket]] and [[Swedish State Railways]]. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as [[Rikstelefon]] to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or [[Royalties|royalty]] problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year, he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to [[Scandinavia]]. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of [[brass]], [[wire]], [[ebonite]], and [[magnet]] steel. Much of the [[walnut]] wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.

Stockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other [[Nordic countries]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called ''Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag'' in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into ''Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In 1884, a multiple-[[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] manual [[telephone exchange]] was mostly copied from a design by C.&amp;nbsp;E. Scribner at [[Western Electric]]. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held [[patent]] 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather "inspiration".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at ''Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag'' combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named ''The [[Telephone magneto|Dachshund]]''.

===International expansion===
[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1961S01536.00001(1).jpg|thumb|upright|An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of [[Nottingham]], England, it is now in the collection of [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]].]]

As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK ([[Ericsson Telephones Ltd.]]) and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the [[National Telephone Company]] was a major customer; by 1897 sold 28% of its output in the UK. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.&lt;ref name="BizHistory" /&gt;

Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. [[Mass production]] techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telephonecollecting.org/Bobs%20phones/Pages/SwedEricsson/EricssonCradles.htm |title=Ericsson Cradles |website=Bobs Phones Page |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, [[KBR (company)|Kellogg]] and [[Automatic Electric]] dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.

===Automatic equipment===
[[File:Ericsson telefonplan 20050902 001.jpg|thumb|LM Ericsson's former headquarters at [[Telefonplan]] in Stockholm, see LM Ericsson building]]

Ericsson ignored the growth of [[automatic telephony]] in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.&lt;ref name="BizHistory" /&gt; [[World War I]], the subsequent [[Great Depression]], and the loss of its Russian assets after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolution]] slowed the company's development while sales to other countries fell by about half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/company/the-consequences-of-expansion/ericsson-and-the-great-depression|title=1931|date=2016-08-30|website=Ericsson.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shareholding changes===
The acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by [[Ivar Kreuger]], an international financier. The company was renamed ''Telefon AB LM Ericsson''. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.&lt;ref name="BizHistory" /&gt;

In 1928, Ericsson began issuing "A" and "B" shares; an "A" share had 1000 votes against a "B" share.  Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few "A" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of "B" shares while maintaining the ''status quo'' of power distribution.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1930, the second issue of "B"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of "A" and "B" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with [[collateral (finance)|security]] given in German state [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].  He then took a loan for his own company [[Kreuger &amp; Toll]] from [[ITT Corporation]] (administered by [[Sosthenes Behn]]), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Ericsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11&amp;nbsp;million{{clarify|reason=which currency?|date=January 2016}} on the deal.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger &amp; Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT cancelled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11&amp;nbsp;million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT owned one-third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Wallenberg era begins===
Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]] (now [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken]]) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the [[Wallenberg family]], and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson "A" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family arranged with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.&lt;ref name="BizHistory" /&gt;

===Market development===
[[File:Ericsson bakelittelefon 1931 sv.jpg|thumb|The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.]]
[[File:Ericsson 1950s bakelite telephone.jpg|thumb|The Ericsson DBH15 telephone, a successor of the DBH 1001 and redesigned in 1947 by Gerard Kiljan]]

In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one-third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.&lt;ref name="BizHistory" /&gt;

Negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and [[switchgear]]. The [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Sales drives resumed after the [[Great Depression]], but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Further development===
Ericsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, [[MTD (mobile network)#MTA|MTA]], in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/19883.php |title=Ericsson Celebrates 50 Years of Mobile Telephony |website=Cellular-news.com |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the [[Ericofon]]. Ericsson [[crossbar switching]] equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries.&lt;ref name="The Economist 1964 p. 1028"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Economist | publisher=Economist Newspaper Limited | issue=v. 211, no. 2 | year=1964 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kte7AAAAIAAJ | access-date=4 May 2019 | page=1028 |quote=... that are visible in Ericsson telephones have also been applied to the continuing improvement of high speed switching ... Ericsson crossbar systems are now standard equipment in many countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 the company introduced the [[ERIPAX]] suite of network products and services.

===1995–2003: emergence of the Internet===
In the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Internet and the New World|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/The-internet-and-the-new-world-/|website=History of Ericsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – "we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)".&lt;ref name="ericsson.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 1996|website=Ericsson|url=https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/investors/documents/financial-reports-and-filings/annual-reports/annualreport1996_en.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ericsson mobil.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An [[Ericsson GH337]] (1995) and [[Ericsson T28]] (1999) mobile phones]]
The growth of [[GSM]], which became a ''de facto'' world standard, combined with Ericsson's other mobile standards, such as [[D-AMPS]] and [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]], meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world's mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188&amp;nbsp;million [[AXE telephone exchange|AXE]] lines in place or on order in 117 countries.&lt;ref name="ericsson.com" /&gt; Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as [[GPRS]] (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a [[3G]] mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the [[WCDMA]] (wideband [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]]) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator [[NTT DoCoMo]] signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called [[FOMA]]. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer [[Qualcomm]] promoted the alternative system [[CDMA2000]], building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ericsson/Qualcomm bitter feud ends|date=29 March 1999|first=Nancy|last=Gohring|url=http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_ericssonqualcomm_bitter_feud/|website=Connected Planet|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109040128/http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_ericssonqualcomm_bitter_feud|archivedate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm's wireless infrastructure business and some R&amp;D resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Short Take: Qualcomm, Ericsson finalize CDMA agreement |url=http://news.cnet.com/Short-Take-Qualcomm,-Ericsson-finalize-CDMA-agreement/2110-1033_3-226260.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171018160816/https://www.cnet.com/news/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-10-18 |work=[[CNET]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet. It announced a partnership with Microsoft to combine its web browser and server software with Ericsson's mobile Internet technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft, Ericsson announce strategic partnership to drive mobile Internet market|url=http://www.mobic.com/oldnews/9912/microsoft.htm|website=Mobic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent joint venture was dissolved in 2001 in the aftermath of the Internet and telecom crashes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Ericsson got caught up in the [[Dot-com bubble]] of the late 1990s. The company's market value increased; its share price peaked at [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 825 in March 2000, from a low of SEK 20 at the start of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shareholder Information {{ndash}} Share Graphs and Figures|url=http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/investors/shareholder-information/share-graphs|website=Ericsson|access-date=7 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202419/http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/investors/shareholder-information/share-graphs|archive-date=14 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars Ramqvist]] resigned as CEO in January 1998, and later became chairperson of the board. [[Sven-Christer Nilsson]] took over as CEO in early 1998, and led the company in a clearer IP direction. Under his leadership, the company's acquisitions including a share in US router company Juniper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ericsson Stake in Juniper|date=18 March 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/18/business/ericsson-stake-in-juniper.html|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ericsson had become a leading player in networks and the production of mobile telephones, sharing top place with [[Nokia]] and [[Motorola]] during 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Problems with Mobile Phones|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/Problems-with-mobile-phones-/|website=History of Ericsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services were becoming increasingly important; Ericsson had offered network rollout services for many years, and had operated networks, but at the end of the 1990s the service operations were amalgamated into a services unit.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In June 1999, Kurt Hellström, the head of Ericsson's mobile division, replaced Nilsson as CEO.  Worldwide hype around the potential of the internet – and for Ericsson, in particular, the mobile internet – had inflated industry expectations.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Operators in many Westernized countries used much of their capital bidding for 3G licenses, and could not afford the new networks required to use the spectrum they had acquired.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The order intake that Ericsson and other telecom vendors had expected, and invested in preparing for, was disappointing, causing job losses and consolidations across the industry.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001.

===2003–2018: rebuilding and growing===
The emergence of full mobile Internet began a period of growth for the global telecom industry, including Ericsson. After the launch of 3G services during 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pike |first=Rebecca |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2856127.stm |title=Business &amp;#124; Italians pick up first 3G mobile phones |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-03-17 |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2808761.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; 3G goes live in the UK |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-03-03 |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; people started to access the Internet using their telephones.

Ericsson's position as a supplier of [[GSM]] equipment to many major operators, and its pioneering role in the emerging 3G standards and associated technology, placed it at the forefront of many of the changes to come. The cutbacks that followed 10 consecutive quarters of losses meant the company could return to profit in Q3 2003, and begin to grow again.  After announcing in 2003 that it had returned to growth, new CEO Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company was to concentrate on operational excellence, a wide-ranging push for efficiency and better return on investment that dominated Ericsson's corporate culture for several years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

During the cutbacks, Ericsson had reduced its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and mainland Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global market share of 25%, but the overall volumes were too low so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Ericsson started a series of acquisitions to strengthen its position in key technologies and market segments.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The first of these was Marconi, a company dating back to the dawn of radio whose assets included a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/changing-the-world/the-future-is-now/acquisition-of-marconi |title=Acquisition of Marconi|publisher=Ericsson |date=2006-05-09 |accessdate=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and [[LHS Telekommunikation]] (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to [[Aastra Technologies]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Aastra Technologies to acquire Ericsson's Enterprise Communication Business |publisher=Aastra |date=18 February 2008 |url=http://www.aastra.com/news-room-2008_1554.htm |accessdate=18 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704233336/http://www.aastra.com/news-room-2008_1554.htm |archivedate=4 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Ericsson to divest its enterprise PBX solutions to Aastra Technologies |publisher=Ericsson |date=18 February 2008 |url=http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/press/releases/20080218-1192670.shtml |accessdate=7 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220194126/http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/press/releases/20080218-1192670.shtml |archivedate=20 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ericsson re-entered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel's CDMA operations and assets in 2009.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The acquisitions followed Ericsson's general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that became more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}40% of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ericsson.com/about-us|title=About Ericsson - Corporate Information|website=Ericsson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Ericsson was working on ways to improve [[WCDMA]] as operators were buying and rolling it out; it was the first generation of 3G access. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called [[High-Speed Packet Access]] (HSPA). It was initially deployed in the download version called [[HSDPA]]; the technology spread from the first test calls in the US in late 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a=1050 |title=Cingular HSDPA Test Successful |publisher=Phone Scoop |date=2005-01-04 |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 59 commercial networks in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/review/2006_03/06.shtml |title=HSDPA performance and evolution |publisher=Ericsson |date= |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; HSPA would provide the world's first mobile broadband.

In July 2016, Hans Vestberg stepped down as Ericsson's CEO after heading the company for six years. Jan Frykhammar, who has been working for the company since 1991 will be stepping in as interim CEO as Ericsson searches for a full-time replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Heater, TechCrunch.

"[https://www.ericsson.com/news/2051527 Ericsson's Board names Börje Ekholm new President and CEO]." 26 October 2016. 26 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Ericsson, Inc. and Ericsson AB have agreed to pay $145,893 to settle potential civil liability for an apparent violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 538 (SSR).1&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Civil Penalty information "https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/CivPen/Documents/20180606_ericsson.pdf"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation===
Around 2000, companies and governments began to push for standards for mobile Internet. In May 2000, the [[European Commission]] created the [[Wireless Strategic Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/ist/docs/ka4/mob_wsi.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171020163404/ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/ist/docs/ka4/mob_wsi.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 October 2017|title=WSI (Wireless Strategic Initiative)|publisher=Ericsson.se|date=1 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, Nokia, [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]] (France), and [[Siemens AG]] (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum in 2001.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld p. 77-IA1"&gt;{{cite book | title=InfoWorld | publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77-IA1 | access-date=2018-12-17 | page=77-IA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1999, Microsoft and Ericsson announced a [[strategic partnership]] to combine the former's web browser and server software with the latter's mobile-internet technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/1999/12-08ericsson.aspx|archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120802225854/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/1999/12-08ericsson.aspx|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2 August 2012|title= Microsoft, Ericsson Team Up to Bring Information Anytime Anywhere, to Carriers and Consumers|publisher= Microsoft.com|date= 8 December 1999|accessdate= 20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst with marked [[Economy of Sweden|economic implications for Sweden]]. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's Internet consulting firms and [[dot-com start-up]]s. In the same year, [[Intel]], the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion deal to supply [[flash memory]] to Ericsson over the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Intel-scores-flash-memory-deal-with-Ericsson/2100-1001_3-236518.html|title=Intel scores flash memory deal with Ericsson |publisher=cnet.com|date=4 February 2000 |accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short-lived joint venture called [[Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB]], owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft, respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.itworld.com/IDG011005MicrosoftMobileJV|title= Microsoft pulls out of mobile JV with Ericsson|publisher=Itworld.com|date= 5 October 2001|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, Ericsson announced the launch of [[Sony Mobile Communications|Sony Ericsson]], a joint venture mobile telephone business, together with [[Sony]] Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericsson.com/press/20011001-1121.html |publisher=Ericsson.com |title=Ericsson – press release Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications established today |date=1 October 2001 |accessdate=20 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020209200043/http://www.ericsson.com/press/20011001-1121.html |archivedate=9 February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony Ericsson remained in operation until February 2012, when Sony bought out Ericsson's share; Ericsson said it wanted to focus on the global wireless market as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericsson.com/news/1558488| title= Sony to acquire Ericsson's share of Sony Ericsson– Press release|publisher= Ericsson.com|date= 27 Oct 2011|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonymobile.com/cws/corporate/press/pressreleases/pressreleasedetails/sonycompletesfullacquisitionofsonyericsson-20120216 |title=Sony Completes Full Acquisition of Sony Ericsson – Press release |publisher=Sonymobile.com |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/684cayXi0?url=http://www.sonymobile.com/cws/corporate/press/pressreleases/pressreleasedetails/sonycompletesfullacquisitionofsonyericsson-20120216 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – [[Motorola]] (U.S.), [[Lucent Technologies]] (U.S.), [[Cisco Systems]] (U.S.), [[telent plc|Marconi]] (UK), [[Siemens AG]] (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world.

With 25 locations in India that have approximately 10,000 employees, Ericsson was creating a large amount of plastic waste – 25,000 bottles a month on average. Knowing the impact of plastics on the environment, both on land and in the oceans (and specifically the Pacific Garbage Patch) Ericsson team in India was keen to find a new approach to providing clean drinking water to their staff. They reviewed the volumes, counted the cost, considered the environmental impact, and then identified a solution – a simple and straightforward water filtration process called reverse osmosis (RO).
The company identified a total of 21 suitable locations (the remaining four were too small to be cost efficient) and in February they installed 150 free-standing RO free systems, thereby removing approximately 25,000 plastic bottles a month from circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ashworth |first1=Tony |title=Reducing plastic waste in India |url=https://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/sustainability_corporateresponsibility/technology-for-good-blog/2018/05/15/reducing-plastic-waste-in-india/ |website=Ericsson.com |accessdate=29 August 2018 |ref=https://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/sustainability_corporateresponsibility/technology-for-good-blog/author/tony-ashworth/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
