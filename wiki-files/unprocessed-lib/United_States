The '''United States of America''' (often called the '''United States''', the '''U.S.''', the '''USA''', or '''America''') is a [[Federal government|federal]] [[constitutional republic]] made of [[U.S. state|fifty states]] and a [[federal district]]. The [[Continental United States|forty-eight contiguous states]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]], are in central [[North America]], between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s. These forty-eight states are bordered by [[Canada]] to the north and [[Mexico]] to the south.

Two states are not next to the other forty-eight states. The state of [[Alaska]] is in the northwest of the continent. Canada is east of Alaska. [[Russia]] is west of Alaska across the [[Bering Strait]]. The state of [[Hawaii]] is an [[archipelago]] in the mid-Pacific.

The United States also owns [[Territories of the United States|several territories]], or [[insular area]]s, in the [[Caribbean]] and Pacific.

The United States is 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km²). There are about 306 million people living in it. This makes the United States the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|third or fourth]] largest country by total area, and third largest by land area and [[List of countries by population|by population]]. The United States is one of the world's most [[Multiethnic society|ethnically diverse]] and [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] nations. This is because of large-scale [[Immigration to the United States|immigration from many countries]].&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Adams| first1 = J.Q.| last2 = Strother-Adams| first2 = Pearlie| title = Dealing with Diversity: The Anthology| year = 2001| publisher = Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company| isbn = 978-0-7872-8145-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]] is the largest national economy in the world, with an estimated 2016 [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of [[United States dollar|US$]] 18.57 trillion (23% of the world total based on nominal GDP and almost 21% at [[purchasing power parity]]).&lt;ref name="IMF GDP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/02/weodata/index.aspx|title=World Economic Outlook Database |publisher= International Monetary Fund |accessdate= 2008-10-27 |date= October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[European Union]] has a larger collective economy, but is not a single nation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nation was founded by [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], which was along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seaboard]]. On July 4, 1776, they issued the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which stated their independence from Britain and their formation of a cooperative union.

The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], comprising ten [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791.

In the 19th century, the United States acquired land from [[Louisiana Purchase|France]], [[Adams-Onís Treaty|Spain]], the [[Oregon Country|United Kingdom]], [[Mexican–American War|Mexico]], and [[Alaska purchase|Russia]], and [[Texas Annexation|annexed]] the [[Republic of Texas]] and the [[Republic of Hawaii]]. Disputes between the [[Southern United States|agrarian South]] and [[Northern United States|industrial North]] over [[states' rights]] and the expansion of the [[Slavery in the United States|institution of slavery]] provoked the [[American Civil War]] of the 1860s. The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|end of legal slavery]] in the United States. By the 1870s, the national economy was the world's largest. The [[Spanish–American War]] and [[World War I]] confirmed the country's status as a military power. In 1945, the United States emerged from [[World War II]] as the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|first country with nuclear weapons]], a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]], and a founding member of [[NATO]]. The end of the [[Cold War]] left the United States as the sole [[superpower]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of the United States}}
=== Foundation ===
The official date of the founding of the United States is [[July 4]], [[1776]], when the second Continental Congress, representing the 13 British secessionists colonies, signed the [[Declaration of Independence]]. However, the structure of the Government had a big change in [[1788]] when the [[Articles of Confederation]] were replaced by the [[Constitution of the United States]]. The date on which each state adopted the Constitution tends to be taken as the date on which the state became part of the Union.

=== Civil War (1861–65) ===
{{main|American Civil War}}
As the nation gained new territory, it was divided on the subject of [[slavery]]. The northern states of the country opposed the slavery of [[African-Americans|African Americans]] and many of them had already been abolished. The southern states of the country said they needed slaves. The [[economy]] of the north grew industrially, while the south was growing on an agricultural basis. Following this division of economy and politics, the southern states decided to create a new independent nation, propitiating the beginning of the war by the northern states who did not recognize the right of secession. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] between the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] (south) and the Union (north), slavery was abolished throughout the American territory.

=== 20th century ===
After the [[Spanish–American War]] in [[1898]], the United States was slowly acquiring an ever-increasing influence in the world. After the [[World War I|first World War]], and then the [[World War II|second]], American influence on aspects such as [[economics]], [[science]], [[technology]], and culture grew to new levels. Because of the [[Cold War]] and the political, ideological and social controversy that resulted, the role of military and international affairs grew in politics at that time. Important events were also held at that time, such as the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s, and the landing of [[Apollo 11]] on the [[Moon]] in [[1969]].

Under President [[George H. W. Bush]], the country took on a global dominant role worldwide, as in the [[Gulf War]] (1991). The longest economic expansion in modern American history, from March 1991 to March 2001, spanned the presidency of [[Bill Clinton]] and the [[dot-com bubble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/ArticleReader?itemid=00003700&amp;print=1|title=IWIN - Why the Expansion of the 1990's Lasted So Long|last=Voyce|first=Bill|date=2006|website=State.ia.us|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006020321/http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/ArticleReader?itemid=00003700&amp;print=1|archive-date=October 6, 2006|access-date=May 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A civil lawsuit and a [[Monica Lewinsky|sex scandal]] led to his [[impeachment]] in 1998, although he managed to finish his period. The [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential elections]], one of the most competitive in American history, they were settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]: [[George W.

On September 11, 2001, the terrorists of the [[Al-Qaeda]] group attacked the twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]] (which were destroyed) and [[the Pentagon]] near [[Washington, D.C.]], in a series of attacks that ended the life of nearly three thousand people. In response, the Bush administration launched the "[[War on Terror]]." At the end of 2001, U.S. forces [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invaded Afghanistan]], toppled the [[Taliban]] government and destroyed Al-Qaeda's training camps. Taliban insurgents continue to fight a [[guerrilla war]].

== Government ==
{{main|Federal government of the United States}}
The United States is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[republic]]. The [[federal government of the United States]] is set up by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. There are three branches. They are the ''[[executive branch]]'', the ''[[legislative branch]]'', and the ''[[judicial branch]]''. State governments and the federal government work in very similar ways. Each state has its own executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The executive branch of a state government is led by a [[governor]], instead of a president.

===Executive branch===
The [[executive branch]] is the part of the government that enforces the law.  Members of the [[U.S. Electoral College]] elect a [[President of the United States|president]] who is the leader of the executive branch, as well as the leader of the [[armed forces]]. The president may [[veto]] a bill that the Congress has passed, so it does not become a law. The President may also make "executive orders" to ensure that people follow the law.

The president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day-to-day actions of government. For example, [[Department of Commerce]] makes rules about trade.  The president chooses the heads of these departments, and also nominates federal judges.  However, the [[Senate]], part of the legislative branch, must agree with all of the people the president chooses. The president may serve two 4-year terms.

===Legislative branch===
[[File:USCapitol.jpg|thumb|right|The west side of the [[United States Capitol]], which is home to the [[United States Congress]]]]
The [[legislative branch]] makes laws. The legislative branch is called the [[United States Congress]]. Congress is divided into two "houses".

One house is the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].  The Representatives are each elected by voters from a set area within a state.  The number of Representatives a state has is based on how many people live there.  Representatives serve two-year terms. The total number of representatives today is 435. The leader of the House of Representatives is the [[Speaker of the House]].

The other house is the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. In the Senate, each state is represented equally, by two senators. Because there are 50 states, there are 100 senators.  The President's [[treaty|treaties]] or appointments of [[official]]s need the Senate's approval. Senators serve six-year terms. The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate.  In practice, the vice president is usually absent from the Senate, and a senator serves as president [[pro tempore]], or [[wikt:temporary|temporary]] president, of the Senate.

Representatives and senators [[proposal|propose]] laws, called "[[bill (law)|bill]]s", in their respective houses. A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group, known as a [[committees of the United States Senate|committee]], which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house. If one house votes to pass a bill, the bill then gets sent to the other house; if both houses vote for it, it is then sent to the president, who may sign the bill into law or [[veto]] it. If the president vetoes the bill, it is sent back to Congress. If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds [[majority]], the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president.

Under the American system of [[federalism]], Congress may not make laws that directly control the states; instead, Congress may use the promise of federal funds, or special circumstances such as national [[emergency|emergencies]], to encourage the states to follow federal law. This system is both complex and unique.

===Judicial branch===
The [[judicial branch]] is the part of government that interprets what the law means. The Judicial Branch is made up of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and many lower courts. If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by [[Constitution|the Constitution]], the law is said to be "struck down" and is no longer a [[validity|valid]] law.

The Supreme Court is made up of nine [[judge]]s, called justices, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. One of these justices, called the [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]], heads the court. A Supreme Court justice serves until he or she dies or [[resignation|resigns]] (quits in the middle of his or her term). When that happens, the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left. If the Senate agrees with that choice, the person becomes a justice. If the Senate does not agree with the president's choice, then the president must nominate someone else.

Famous court cases such as ''[[Marbury v. Madison|Marbury v Madison]]'' (which was decided in 1803) have firmly established that the Supreme Court is the [[Interpreter|ultimate interpreter]] of the [[United States Constitution]] and has the power to strike down any law that [[conflict]]s with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landmarkcases.org/marbury/home.html Street Law, Inc]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{see also|States of the United States|Politics of the United States}}
[[File:Political System of the United States.svg|thumb|The political system of the United States]]
The United States of America consists of [[States of the United States|50 state]]s, 5 territories and 1 district ([[Washington D.C]].). States can make laws about things inside the state, but federal law is about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries. In some areas, if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws, people must follow the federal law because the state law is not a law any more. Each state has a constitution of its own, different from the federal (national) Constitution. Each of these is like the federal Constitution because they say how each state's government is set up, but some also talk about specific laws.

The federal and most state governments are dominated by two [[Political party|political parties]]: the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] and the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]]. There are many smaller parties; the largest of these are the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]]. People help in political [[campaign]]s that they like. They try to persuade politicians to help them; this is called [[lobbying]]. All Americans are allowed to do these things, but some have and spend more money than others, or in other ways do more in politics. Some people think this is a problem, and lobby for rules to be made to change it.

Since 2017, the president is a Republican, and Congress is also Republican-controlled, so the Republicans have more power in the federal government.  There are still many powerful Democrats who can try to stop the Republicans from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country. Also, members of a party in power do not always agree on what to do. If enough people decide to vote against Republicans in the next election, they will lose power. In a republic like the United States, no party can do whatever they want. All politicians have to argue, compromise, and make deals with each other to get things done. They have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes.

The USA's large [[Culture|cultural]], economic, and military influence has made the [[foreign policy of the United States]], or relations with other countries, a topic in American politics, and the politics of many other countries.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the United States}}
The United States is the fourth biggest country in the world by land [[area]]. Only [[Russia]], [[Canada]] and [[China]] are bigger. The U.S's [[geography]] varies a lot and includes:
* [[forest]]s and grass fields on the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]]
* the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the east
* the [[Great Plains]] in the middle of the country
* the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]-[[Missouri River|Missouri]] river in the middle of the country
* the [[Rocky Mountains]] west of the [[plain]]s
* [[desert]]s and coastal areas west of the Rocky Mountains
* [[forest]]s in the [[Pacific Northwest]]
* [[Arctic]] regions of Alaska
* [[volcano|volcanic]] islands in Hawaii
* a long [[coastline]] with many [[beach]]es
* the [[everglades]] in [[Florida]]
The [[climate]] varies along with the geography, from [[tropical]] (hot and wet in [[summer]], warm and dry in [[winter]]) in [[Florida]] to [[tundra]] (cold all year) in Alaska. Large parts of the country have warm summers and cold winters. Some parts of the United States, like parts of California, have a [[Mediterranean climate]].
===States===
{{see also|List of U.S. states}}

The United States [[Military conquest|conquered]] and [[Purchase|bought]] new lands over time, and grew from the original 13 colonies in the east to the current 50 states, of which 48 of them are [[Contigny|joined together]] to make up the [[Continental United States|contiguous United States]]. These states, called the "lower 48", can all be reached by [[road]] without crossing a [[border]] into another country. They go from the Atlantic east to the [[Pacific Coast|Pacific]] in the west. There are two other states which are not joined to the lower 48 states. [[Alaska]] can be reached by passing through [[British Columbia]] and the [[Yukon]], both of which are part of Canada. [[Hawaii]] is located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is so far from the rest of the US that it can only be reached by [[airplane]].

[[Washington, D.C.]], the national capital, is a [[federal district]] that was split from the states of [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] in 1791. Not part of any US state, it used to be in the shape of a [[square]], with the land west of the [[Potomac River]] coming from Virginia, and the land east of the river coming from Maryland. In 1846, Virginia took back its part of the land. Some people living in DC want it to become a state, or for Maryland to take back its land, so that they can have the [[right to vote]] in Congress.

===Territories and possessions===
The United States consists of sixteen lands that are not states, many of which are [[Colony|colonial]] [[Territory|territories]]. None of them have any land [[border]]s with the rest of the US. People live in five of these places, which are ''[[de facto]]'' American:
* [[Puerto Rico]]
* [[American Samoa]]
* [[Guam]]
* [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]
* [[Northern Mariana Islands]]

The [[Philippines]] was a [[possession]] of the United States. [[Palau]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], and other [[Pacific Islands|Pacific island]] nations were governed by the United States as a United Nations "Trust Territory". All of these places have become [[independence|independent]]: the Philippines in 1946, Palau in 1947, and Micronesia in 1986.

The [[U.S. armed forces]] has [[Military base|base]]s in many countries, and the [[U.S. Navy]]'s base at [[Guantanamo Bay]] was rented from [[Cuba]] after that country had a [[Communist]] revolution.

===Counties and cities===
{{see also|List of United States cities by population}}
All the states are divided into [[Administrative division|administrative subdivisions]]. Most of them are called [[County|counties]], but [[Louisiana]] uses the word "[[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]]," and [[Alaska]] uses the word "[[borough]]."

There are many [[City|cities]] in the United States. One city in each state is the [[List of U.S. state capitals|state capital]], where the government of the state meets and the [[governor]] works. This city is not always the largest in its state. For example, the city with the most people living in it is [[New York City]] in [[New York (state)|New York State]], but the state capital is [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Some other big cities are [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]; [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; [[Miami]], [[Florida]]; [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]; [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]; [[Houston]] and [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]; [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]; [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]; [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].

==Economy==
The United States has a [[capitalist]] [[economy]]. The country has rich [[mineral]] [[Natural resource|resource]]s, with many [[gold]], [[coal]] and [[uranium]] deposits. [[Farming]] makes the country among the top producers of, among others, [[corn]] ([[maize]]), [[wheat]], [[sugar]], and [[tobacco]]. America produces [[Automobile|car]]s, [[airplane]]s, and [[electronics]]. About 3/4 of Americans work in the [[service industry]].

The top 15 trading partners in terms of total trade are:

The United States of America has people of many different [[race (sociology)|race]] and [[ethnic group|ethnic]] backgrounds. 80% of the people in the United States [[:wikt:descend|descend]] from [[Europe]]an [[immigration|immigrants]]. Many people are descended from [[Germany]], [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Africa]], and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geolytics.com/?gclid=CK7Nw9bgpJYCFRJ4xgod32jc5g Demographic Data, US Census &amp; GIS Software &amp;#124; GeoLytics]&lt;/ref&gt;  13% of the people in the United States are [[African-American]]. Most of them descend from the [[slave trade|African slaves that were brought to America]]. [[Asian]]-Americans make up only 5% of the population in America but make up a bigger portion in the west coast. For example, in [[California]], Asian-Americans make up 13% of the population of that state. [[Hispanic]]-Americans or people of Latin origins make up 15% of the nation. The original peoples, called [[Native American]], American Indians, or Amerindians and [[Inuit]] ([[Eskimo]]s) are a very small group.

11% of the people in the United States are foreign born. 18% speak a language other than English at home. For people 25 and older, 80% are [[high school]] [[graduation|graduates]] while 25% have a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.

The 2000 Census counted self-reported [[ancestor|ancestry]]. It identified 43 million German-Americans, 30.5 million Irish-Americans, 24.9 million African-Americans, 24.5 million English-Americans, and 18.4 million Mexican-Americans.

=== Money ===
The [[social]] [[structure]] of the United States has a big range. This means that some Americans are much, much richer than others. The [[average]] ([[median]]) [[income]] for an American was $37,000 a year in 2002. However, the [[wealthy|richest]] 1% of Americans have as much money as the [[poor]]est 90%. 51% of all households have access to a [[computer]] and 41% had access to the [[Internet]] in 2000, a figure which had grown to 75% in 2004. Also, 67.9% of American families owned their homes in 2002.  There are 200 million cars in the United States, two for every three Americans. The debt has grown to over $21,000,000,000,000.

=== Religion ===
There are many different [[religion]]s in the U.S.  [[Statistics|Statistically]], the largest religion is [[Christianity]], including groups such as [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] and [[Mormonism]]. Other religions include [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Wicca]], [[Druidry]], [[Baha'i]], [[Raelism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;Media, Minorities, and Meaning: A Critical Introduction - Page 88, Debra L. Merskin - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Religions which were founded within the United States include [[Eckankar]], [[Satanism]] and [[Scientology]].  [[Native American mythology|Native American religion]]s have various [[animism|animistic]] beliefs.

The United States is one of the most [[religious]] countries in the [[Western World]], and most Americans believe in [[God]]. The number of Christians in the U.S. has gone down. 86.2% called themselves Christian in 1990 and 78.4% said this in 2007. The others include Judaism (2.3%), Islam (0.8%), [[Buddhism]] (0.7%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%). Those who have no religion are at 16.1%. There is a large difference between those who say that they belong to a religion and those who are members of a religious body of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/affiliations-all-traditions.pdf Religion in America: U.S. Religious Data, Demographics and Statistics &amp;#124; Pew Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States does not have an official [[language]], the [[United States Congress]] has considered officially designating [[English language|English]] as such for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/unitedstatesofamerica/a/unitedstatesfacts.htm|title=United States Facts - Ten Interesting and Unusual United States Facts|publisher=Geography|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since it is the most used language, and the language in which the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and [[United States Constitution]] are written. 38 states out of 50 have English as the official language. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] has increased in usage in certain sectors of society, due to a flow of immigrants—especially from Mexico and Cuba. French is also a main language in parts of [[Louisiana]] because [[France]] once owned the area as a colony.

==Culture==
American [[popular culture]] goes out to many places in the world. It has a large [[influence]] on most of the world, especially the [[Western hemisphere|Western]] world. American [[music]] is heard all over the world, and American movies and [[television]] shows can be seen in most countries.
