[[File:C2E2 2014 - Wonder Woman (14085194317).jpg|thumb|Wonder Woman cosplay]]
'''Wonder Woman''' is a [[superhero]] who appears in comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. She is one of the first female superheroes in American comic books and the most famous, most recognizable female superhero in the world. [[William Moulton Marston]], a [[psychologist]] who believed that women could be as strong and powerful as men, created Wonder Woman, partly inspired by his wife, Elizabeth Holloway-Marston. Wonder Woman first appeared in the pages of [[All-Star Comics|All-Star Comics # 8]], published in December 1941. Her first solo comic book debuted in the summer of 1942, when [[Wonder Woman#1|Wonder Woman # 1]] was published.

== Story ==
In the comic book, Wonder Woman's real name is Diana, and she is the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, ruler of the [[Amazons]], a race of peace-loving women who lived in an island named Themyscira (also referred to as Paradise Island). Soon after Steve Trevor, a [[US Air Force]] pilot, crash-lands on Paradise Island during [[World War II]], Diana and the amazons tend to his wounds and help him recover. Diana decides that she will bring him back to the [[United States]]; once there she becomes the superhero that the world calls ''Wonder Woman''. Her best-known powers are superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes, as well as flight. She has a magic [[lasso]] that compels those bound by it to tell the truth, and unbreakable [[bracelet|gauntlet]]s that can deflect bullets.

== Villains ==
Among her villains, the best known are:
* Ares - the Greek god of war, whose energy and almost infinite powers are fueled by war and hatred among humans
* Circe - an ancient sorceress who can transform men into animals
* The Cheetah - a British archaeologist who possesses an ancient mystical artifact that turns her into a Cheetah-like were woman with incredible  speed,reflexes, andstrength, and thirst for blood
* Silver Swan - a flying villainess whose main power is a highly destructive sonic cry
* Dr. Psycho - a powerful [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] man with a deep hatred for women
* Devastation - a powerful villainess with powers that mirror Wonder Woman's; she was created by the [[Kronos|children of Chronus]] in order to destroy Wonder Woman and help take over [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]]

== In Other media ==
Wonder Woman had also appeared in [[animation|animated]] [[cartoon]]s and in a [[live-action]] [[television program]] in the 1970s with actress [[Lynda Carter]]. The series made the character very famous.

In January 2001, [[movie producer|producer]] [[Joel Silver]] asked Todd Alcott to write a ''Wonder Woman'' [[screenplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Brian Linder | url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/036/036742p1.html | title=''Wonder Woman'' Scribe Chosen | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early [[wikt:rumor|rumours]] listed [[actor|actresses]] such as [[Mariah Carey]], [[Sandra Bullock]], and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] to play the role of Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Hank Stuever | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A29691-2001Apr17 | title=Wonder Woman's Powers | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Leonard Goldberg]], speaking in a May 2001 interview, named Sandra Bullock as a strong candidate for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Brian Linder | url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/057/057655p1.html | title=Estrogen Explosion | publisher=IGN | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bullock said that she was asked to play the role. [[Lucy Lawless]] and [[Chyna]] both were interested in it. The screenplay then went through many versions written by many different [[screenwriter|writers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Rob Worley | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=2214 | title=''Wonder Woman'' Scribe | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By August 2003, Levens was replaced by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Rob Worley | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=2692 | title=Wonder Woman | publisher=Comic Book Resources | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, [[Warner Bros.]] said that [[Joss Whedon]] would write and [[movie director|direct]] the [[movie]] version of ''Wonder Woman.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1038969,00.html | title=Silver Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures Sign Joss Whedon to Write &amp; Direct DC Comics' ''Wonder Woman'' | publisher=Warner Bros. | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Whedon was directing ''[[Serenity (movie)|Serenity]]'' at the time and needed time to learn Wonder Woman's background, he did not start writing until late 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jim Kozak | url=http://www.infocusmag.com/05augustseptember/whedonuncut.htm | title=Serenity Now! | publisher=In Focus | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silver wanted to movie ''Wonder Woman'' in [[Australia]] once the script was finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Australian Associated Press | authorlink = Australian Associated Press | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Aussie-Wonder-Woman/2005/05/11/1115585012566.html?oneclick=true | title=Aussie Wonder Woman | publisher=[[The Age]] | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2005, Whedon said that he would not cast Wonder Woman until he finished the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Scott Collura | url=http://www.nowplayingmag.com/content/view/1532/2/ | title=Whedon Talking Wonder | publisher=Now Playing | accessdate=August 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charisma Carpenter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Matt Mitovitch | url=http://tvguide.com/News/Insider/default.htm?cmsRedir=true&amp;rmDate=09062006&amp;cmsGuid={E882AF71-8A9B-4A2C-8781-2F480C8A38E5}| title= Mars Bombshell Is Still Wonder-ing | publisher=[[TV Guide]] | accessdate=September 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Morena Baccarin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Rebecca Murray | url=http://movies.about.com/od/serenity/a/serenmb092605.htm | title=Morena Baccarin on "Serenity," Joss Whedon, and "Wonder Woman" | publisher=[[About.com]] | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; said they were interested in the role.

In February 2007, Whedon left the project. He said there were problems with differences about the script between the [[movie studio|studio]] and himself.&lt;ref name="whedon"&gt;{{cite news | author=Joss Whedon | url=http://whedonesque.com/comments/12385 | title=Satin Tights No Longer. | publisher=Whedonesque | accessdate=February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whedon said that since he was not doing the ''Wonder Woman'' project, he would focus on making his movie ''Goners''.&lt;ref name="whedon" /&gt;

[[Gal Gadot]] played Wonder Woman in the upcoming 2016 action movie ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. She was also the lead role of the 2017 superhero film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 movie)|Wonder Woman]]''.

Wonder Woman Will Appear In The 2019 Film, [[The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part]], Voiced By [[Hailee Steinfeld]].
