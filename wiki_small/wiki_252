Demographics of Armenia

After registering a steady increase during Soviet period, the population of Armenia declined from peak value 3.633 mln in 1992 to 2.986 mln in 2017.

The country's population has declined due to increased emigration since the break-up of the Soviet Union. The rates of emigration and population decline, however, have decreased in recent years, and there has been a moderate influx of Armenians returning to Armenia.

According to 2016 human development report Armenia has the highest inequality-adjusted HDI and the lowest coefficient of human inequality compared to all of its neighbouring countries.

During soviet period life expectancy was traditionally high in Armenia and topped all other republics of USSR and most of countries in Eastern Europe in 1978-1980.

After setback during 1986-1996 mostly due to Spitak Earthquake and Nagorno-Karabakh conflict Armenia regained its positions and was consistently among three best former soviet republics during 1997-2016 and topped the list in 2007.

In 2016 the average life expectancy at birth for males was 71.6 years and for females – 78.3 years, average stood at 75.0 .

Most Armenians are Christian, primarily of Apostolic Church rite. Armenia is considered the first nation to adopt Christianity, which was first preached in Armenia by two Apostles of Jesus, St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddeus in the 1st century. The Armenian Apostolic Church can trace its roots back to the 3rd and 4th centuries. The country formally adopted the Christian faith in 301 A.D. Over 90% of Armenians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the Coptic and Syrian churches. Armenia also has a population of Catholics and evangelical Protestants.
